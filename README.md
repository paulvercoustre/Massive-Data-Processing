Massive Data Processing Course

1rst Assignement

You are asked to implement an inverted index in MapReduce for the document corpus of: 
pg100.txt (from http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/100/pg100.txt), 
pg31100.txt (from http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/31100/pg31100.txt)
pg3200.txt (from http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/3200/pg3200.txt). 

This corpus includes the complete works of William Shakespear, Mark Twain and Jane Austen, respectively.
An inverted index provides for each distinct word in a document corpus, the filenames that contain this word, along with some other information (e.g., count/position within each document).
